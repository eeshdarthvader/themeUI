# ThemeBook

A Tiny Component Library and Design System Starter.

[Storybook](https://themebook-storybook.vercel.app/)

It has basic extendible components and basic plumbing using rollup with publish process.

## Setup

Download or clone the repository and run the following commands from the root directory locally

```
yarn
```

## Build and Run Storybook

```
yarn build-storybook
yarn storybook
```

## Publish

This should be part of your CI pipeline

```
npm run publish
```

This creates files array for publishing in `package.json` and then uses `semantic-release` to publish to npm

## Directory structure thought process

The directory structure looks like this

```
themebook
  src
    components
    tokens
    utils
```

## Bundling

Using `rollup`

We build the JSX into transpiled version inside `packages`.
Bundling is upto the consumer application.

```js
import Button from 'themebook/packages/Button';
```

and if you want to use the `ES` version you can import it like this

```js
import Button from 'themebook/packages/es/Button';
```

## Theming

Theme file is defined in

```
src\theme\theme.js
```

You can use `useTheme` hook or `withTheme` HOC to get theme prop in your project.

To override this basic theme, just provide your own theme object and pass it down to `ThemeProvider`

#### Example

```js
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components';
import App from './App';

const Root = () => (
    <ThemeProvider theme={{ ...yourOwntheme }}>
        <React.Fragment>
            <App />
        </React.Fragment>
    </ThemeProvider>
);

ReactDOM.render(<Root />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

## Contributing
